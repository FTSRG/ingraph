# LDBC Social Network Benchmark â€“ Interactive workload

The Cypher implementations are taken from the [LDBC specification v0.2.2](https://github.com/ldbc/ldbc_snb_docs/blob/bf8ead188f85639e203d4507cbade453c1298bee/LDBC_SNB_v0.2.2.pdf)

## Paths and legacy Cypher features used by the queries

| query                 | [1](original/query-1.cypher) | [2](original/query-2.cypher) | [3](original/query-3.cypher) | [4](original/query-4.cypher) | [5](original/query-5.cypher) | [6](original/query-6.cypher) | [7](original/query-7.cypher) | [8](original/query-8.cypher) | [9](original/query-9.cypher) | [10](original/query-10.cypher) | [11](original/query-11.cypher) | [12](original/query-12.cypher) | [13](original/query-13.cypher) | [14](original/query-14.cypher) |

Technically, Q10 has a variable length path, but the length of the path is `2..2`.

## "Standardized" and "globalized" versions

For simpler testing, we "globalized" the SNB queries, i.e. we removed parametric bindings to specific variables. For example, if a query started from a specific person, the globalized query start from all persons.

We removed queries using non-standard openCypher constructs (e.g. `allShortestPaths`), and changed parameters to use the standard `$param` notation instead of the deprecated `{param}` one.
