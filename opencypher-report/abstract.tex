The last decade brought considerable improvements in non-relational storage and query technologies, known collectively as NoSQL systems.
Most of these systems were designed to suit the needs of Big Data and real-time web applications, hence they use specialized data models: key-value, document, wide columns, graph databases, etc.
While they offer high performance for their specific use cases, a major shortcoming of these systems is the lack of standardization. Consequently, migrating datasets or applications between technologies often requires a large amount of manual work or ad-hoc solutions, thus subjecting the users to the possibility of vendor lock-in.

To avoid this threat, NoSQL vendors are working on supporting existing standard languages (\eg SQL) and introducing standardized languages. In this paper, we present formal definitions for openCypher, a high-level declarative graph query language with an on-going standardization effort.
