[[report on openCypher TCK results]](http://docs.inf.mit.bme.hu/ingraph/pub/opencypher-report.pdf) | [[regression tests]](http://docs.inf.mit.bme.hu/ingraph/tests/regressionTests/)

For a summary on the project, visit the [ingraph web page](http://docs.inf.mit.bme.hu/ingraph/).

## Projects

ingraph is defined as a single Gradle project, so it can be built in a single step. However, the subprojects are split to two categories:

1. `ingraph-compiler`, which compiles openCypher queries to relational algebra expressions (search plans / Rete networks). The compiler components are built using EMF-based technologies (Xcore, Xtend, Xtext and VIATRA), so we recommended the Eclipse IDE for developing them.

2. `ingraph-engine`, which evaluates relational algebra expressions. The engine is built using Scala-based technologies (Akka, ScalaTest and Scala Cukes), so we recommend contributors to use IntelliJ IDEA for developing these components.

### Developing the compiler

#### Prerequisites

Start with [Eclipse Oxygen](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/Oxygen/) and select **Eclipse IDE for Java and DSL Developers** distribution. It is recommended to increase the memory available for Eclipse: edit the `eclipse.ini` file and set a larger value, e.g. `-Xmx2G`.

Required dependencies:

* Install the **VIATRA Query and Transformation SDK** 1.6.0.M3 plug-in from the [VIATRA milestone update site](http://download.eclipse.org/viatra/updates/milestone/).

Recommended dependencies:

1. Go to **Help** | **Eclipse Marketplace...** and install the **EditorConfig** plug-in.
1. Install the Eclipse Groovy tooling from <https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse/wiki> to provide an editor for the `.gradle` configuration files.

:notebook_with_decorative_cover: The _Oxygen_ release of the _DSL Developers_ flavor has the required dependencies for Xtend, Xtext and Xcore. If you start from another Eclipse flavor, you should install the missing plug-ins:

* Install the following from the update site of your Eclipse release (e.g. the Oxygen update site):
  * **Xtend IDE**
  * **Xtext Complete SDK**
  * **EMF - Eclipse Modeling Framework Xcore SDK**

#### Importing the projects

1. Build the projects from command line with the following command:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew clean build eclipse -x test
    ```

    This will generate 1. source files from the Xcore model and 2. the Eclipse project files.
1. Import the project with **Import...** | **Gradle** | **Gradle Project**, select the `ingraph-compiler` directory. Note that you *should not* select the `ingraph` directory, but the compiler's directory instead. When prompted whether to overwrite existing project files, click **Keep**.

Optionally, you might also import the `ingraph-engine` directory.

#### Opening relational algebra models

1. Open the `relalg` models with the **Sample Reflective Ecore Model Editor**.

#### Using VIATRA

1. Go to **Window** | **Preferences** | **VIATRA** | **Query Explorer** and make sure that the **Dynamic EMF mode** is _turned on_ (it is turned off by default).
1. Use the **Query Explorer** view and do not load the model by clicking the green play button, instead click to the downward pointing triangle and click **Load Resource**.
1. Open the `vql` query specification.
1. Click the **green play button** to load the query.

### Developing the engine

#### Prerequisites

* Install the [Scala plug-in](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/idea/plugin/1347-scala).

*Note.* Currently, there are is no VIATRA plug-in for IntelliJ. You are able to use the previously defined patterns, but cannot define new patterns or edit existing ones.

#### Importing the projects

* Import the projects using **New** | **Project from Existing Sources...**.
  * Tick **Auto import**
  * Untick **Create separate module per source set**.
* In the Gradle view, click **Execute Gradle Task** and set the **Command line** textbox to `build -x test`. This will generate source files from the Xcore model.
* After importing, add the Scala SDK (version 2.11) to the module. (If you did not use Scala before, download it from the dialog box provided by IntelliJ).

## Debug mode

You can define environment variables to enable debug mode, for all ingraph projects or only for specific modules:

* `DEBUG=1` or `DEBUG_INGRAPH=1` enables debug mode for all modules
* `DEBUG_<MODULENAME>=1` (e.g. `DEBUG_INGRAPH_CYPHER2SEARCH=1`) enables debug mode for that particular module

Currently, these modules have support for debugging:

* `ingraph-cypher2search`

## Pages

* [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)
* [Deploying binary artifacts](deploying-binary-artifacts.md)

## Third-party dependencies

For parsing queries, we use the [Slizaa openCypher Xtext grammar](https://github.com/slizaa/slizaa-opencypher-xtext).
