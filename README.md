## Contributor's guide

ingraph is defined as a Gradle project.

### Prerequisites

* We recommend using IntelliJ for developing ingraph. Make sure you install the [Scala plug-in](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/idea/plugin/1347-scala).
* For SRE and other Clojure projects we recommend Emacs with [CIDER](https://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). If you want to develop Clojure in IntelliJ, check out [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/).

### Importing the projects

* Import the projects using **New** | **Project from Existing Sources...** (or simply click **Import Project** on the welcome screen).
  * Select the `ingraph` directory.
  * Tick **Auto import**.
  * ~~Untick **Create separate module per source set**.~~ Until this [IntelliJ issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/SCL-12718) is resolved, tick **Create separate module per source set**.
  * Pick **Use default gradle wrapper** as your Gradle installation.
* After importing, add the Scala SDK (version 2.11) to the module. (If you did not use Scala before, download it from the dialog box provided by IntelliJ).
