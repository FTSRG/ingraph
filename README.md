## Contributor's guide

### Prerequisites

We recommend using IntelliJ for developing ingraph. Make sure you install the [Scala plug-in](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/idea/plugin/1347-scala).

### Initializing test data

Clean any data that might left over and unzip the test data set:

```console
rm -rf graphs/ldbc-snb-bi/db-sftiny/graph.db/
unzip graphs/ldbc-snb-bi/db-sftiny.zip -d graphs/ldbc-snb-bi/
```

### Importing the projects

* Import the projects using **New** | **Project from Existing Sources...** (or simply click **Import Project** on the welcome screen).
  * Select the `ingraph` directory.
  * Tick **Auto import**.
  * ~~Untick **Create separate module per source set**.~~ Until this [IntelliJ issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/SCL-12718) is resolved, tick **Create separate module per source set**.
  * Pick **Use default gradle wrapper** as your Gradle installation.
  * If you get errors while trying to run tests, perform a manual build.
