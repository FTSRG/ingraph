## Import the CSV files to Neo4j/ingraph

Set the `$NEO4J_HOME` and the following environment variables appropriately:

```bash
export POSTFIX=_0_0.csv
export DB_DIR=$NEO4J_HOME/data/databases/graph.db
```

### Duplicate ids and fix labels

CSV files require a bit of preprocessing â€“ both for ingraph.

```bash
./duplicate-ids.sh
./fix-labels.sh
```

### Neo4j: delete your database and load the SNB CSVs

Be careful - this deletes all data in your database.

```bash
./delete-neo4j-database.sh
./replace-headers.sh
./import-to-neo4j.sh
```

Restart Neo4j.

## Stuff that we currently ignore

We ignore some files as they are difficult to load and none of the queries need them.

### Property files

All of them:

* person_speaks_language
* person_email_emailaddress

## Misc

Regex for extracting relationship names (Atom):

`(\w+)_(\w+)_(\w+)` -> `--relationship:$2 $1_$2_$3`
